          <p>
            Calorie Rush: The Marathon marks as my very first Unity Project. Game controls, animation controller, soundeffects and world building point out the key achievements acquired while developing this game. I implemented a pooling system that allowed me to build an endless world cost efficiently. The use of power ups not only helps the player to get further in game but also adds to its fun game mechanics.
