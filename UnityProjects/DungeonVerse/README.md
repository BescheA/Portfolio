# DungeonVerse

## 1. Introduction

DungeonVerse is my most current project that I am working on.

**Game Concept**

DungeonVerse plays in a universe where the world as we know it clashes with all kind of different worlds. From Elven Realms to Dwarf villages to fantasy inspired dungeons, we find ourselves stuck in a magical realm that mixes worlds from different universes. We need to figure out what caused the clash and how we can reverse it.

In DungeonVerse you play as a middle aged family man who was magically teleported in this mixed universe. The player collects item, upgrades his character progresses in a Level based world, finding hidden clues and artifacts that help him reverse this catastrophie. Enemies, traps and magical puzzles make each level engaging and challenging.
