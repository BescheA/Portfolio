            It began as a quiet, beautiful evening—just another night after work when Steven decided to go shopping. At the busy Pacific Mall, everything seemed normal…until a sudden, loud explosion shattered the calm. The ground shook and the sky glowed with a mysterious light, and in an instant, Steven was knocked to the ground.

When he awoke, he found himself in a strange dungeon. Confused and in pain, he started exploring his eerie surroundings—and then he realized something shocking: he recognized the building. How could a familiar place be hidden inside this mysterious maze? What had happened? Where was he?

Get ready to join an unforgettable adventure in DungeonVerse, where every step brings you closer to uncovering the truth behind that fateful bang.

            DungeonVerse is an innovative adventure game that blends classic dungeon exploration with modern game mechanics. Inspired by the distinctive low-poly visual style of Synty Studios, DungeonVerse invites players into a mysterious, ever-changing maze where every corner holds surprises. In this project, I focused on creating a visually striking environment using stylized, geometric art, while also developing fluid gameplay mechanics that challenge players to navigate, solve puzzles, and uncover hidden secrets.

Using Unity as the game engine, I implemented dynamic camera controls, smooth character movement, and interactive elements that bring the dungeon to life. DungeonVerse not only showcases my skills in game design and programming but also reflects my passion for immersive storytelling and creative visual design.

Whether you’re a casual gamer or a hardcore enthusiast, DungeonVerse offers a fresh and engaging experience that redefines what a dungeon crawler can be. Explore the unknown, embrace the mystery, and step into a world where every decision could lead to adventure—or danger.
